# Eerie CSS

Dead simple, this is just an HTML page with some CSS to achieve a sort of shaky, old film effect. It's somewhat like the flickering effect seen in games like Limbo (http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/), done solely with CSS and CSS transitions.

Some other elements have been added for effect, such as fonts and hover effects.
